    "#### *Description of document*\n",
    "*this document is for trying to make a WNT ring in the outer border. One way of approaching this is letting the WNT be activated only by SMAD+ NOGGIN- cells (red). This way we force it to begin in the edge, since NOGGIN will dominate the center. We assume that at some point we can make the SMAD+ NOGGIN- ring larger, so we just need to focus on making the rules for WNT.*\n",

    "##### ***Rules WNT***\n",
    " - The cell should begin on the edge (red cells with only 3/4 neighbours) (later alternatively only activated by red cells)\n",
    " - The cell should have a self-activation programmed (activates as soon as $SMAD$ has converted one cell.)\n",
    "      - Basically activates as soon as WNT is present. This activation is given in the PDE model by $f(u) = \\frac{s_u u^2}{1+ \\kappa_u u^4}$ meaning that for small values of WNT ($u$) we have an activating effect with $f(u) > 0$ and for bigger values it is degrading $f(u) \\approx 0$"

This value increases due to WNT activation everywhere until the threshold value for NODAL given by $v$ exceeds the threshhold, that is $v > v_{th}$.
